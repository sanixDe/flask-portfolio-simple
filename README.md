```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildwithdan/flask-portfolio.git
cd flask-portfolio
flask --debug --app api.index run
```

# Running it on Docker

>Read carefully!   

>This was created for educational purposes mainly, ie me getting to understand Docker and how to create images from a github project.

>If you want to change anything on the website, like name, text etc. You will need to clone OR fork this [Project on Github](https://github.com/buildwithdan/flask-portfolio), then amend the html documents in "api/templates".   

Then you can rebuild the docker image and then deploy as needed. Go into the project folder where the dockerfile is located and run this.   
```docker build -t appname .``` 

This docker image was created in such a way, to allow for adding the Markdown files for the <strong>blogs</strong> and <strong>projects</strong> locally in your docker host machine. This is achieved by created a symlink between the container folder and the host system.   

In the "docker run" command below you will see:   
Both the part in bold will need to be replaced with a location in your local machine.You can create a folder for each and then use ```pwd``` command in your terminal to find the location, after your created
 - -v <strong>/path/to/blogs</strong>:/app/api/content/posts \
 - -v <strong>/path/to/projects</strong>:/app/api/content/projects \

As example:
 - -v <strong>Users/dnell/documents/website/blog</strong>:/app/api/content/posts
 - -v <strong>Users/dnell/documents/website/projects</strong>:/app/api/content/projects

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))
